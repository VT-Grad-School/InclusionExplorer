,Architecture and Urban Studies,Focus on Faculty Mentoring,"In the past, women and minorities were excluded from the built-environment professions. For years, CAUS has striven to increase the participation of these historically underrepresented groups as students, faculty and staff. Today, just over half of the college students are female. The share of junior female faculty has also increased substantially (48% of Assistant Professors), but remains lower at the senior ranks (37% of Associate Professor and 27% of Full Professors). The share of minority faculty is in need of greater attention, as the share of minority students and those of mixed race has increased. With the goal of improving faculty development, CAUS is launching a series of steps to enhance the quality of mentoring and thus help faculty, especially female and minority faculty, succeed in scholarship, promotion and tenure. These steps should also help enhance overall faculty satisfaction with college mentoring as expressed, for example, in the COACHE survey. In the long term, a successful faculty with substantial representation of women and minorities will help further diversify the composition of the student body and will also help diverse students succeed (i.e., since the faculty can serve as role models to the students). It will also enrich all scholarship, design-build, instruction and engagement activities at CAUS.",,Access and Success; Education and Scholarship,,Faculty Members; Staff Members; Undergraduate Students; Graduate and Professional Students; Community

The IAWA began at a time when the share of CAUS’s female students and faculty was very small. Today, over half of the college students are female. However, further progress must be made in attracting female faculty (especially at the senior level) and promoting them. The current composition of the tenure-stream faculty is as follows: Professors (73% male, 27% female), Associate Professors (63% male, 37% female) and Assistant Professors (52% male, 48% female).
